			<b>Paranormal Entity: The Simpson College Seal</b><br>

			Outside of College Hall there is a metallic seal implanted into the sidewalk with the Simpson College logo on it. This seal is believed to be anomalous in nature, haunted by the ghost of Mildred Hedges. According to the reports, students who step on the seal preform inadequately on their next exam. Students have explained that they would get their tests back and notice inexplainable mistakes that they would never make otherwise.
