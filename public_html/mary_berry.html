        <h1>Marry Berry Story: </h1>
    
            <p>Mary Berry is the building where Mildred once lived. Now students have reported seeing her looking out the windows long after                                closing hours. Professors with offices in Mary Berry have reported hearing footsteps when no one else is in the building.</p>
            
            <p>Others think this is just a myth, until they spot her in a window!</p>
