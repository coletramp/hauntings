			<b>Paranormal Entity: Mildred Hedges</b><br>
			Mary Berry used to be the dorm where Mildred Hedges lived. Since the incident of 1935 students have reported seeing her staring out the windows after closing hours. Faculty within the building have reported hearing inexplainable footsteps and noises.

			<br><br><b>Paranormal Entity: The Whiteboard of Room 120</b><br>
			Students have reported sightings of strange drawings on the whiteboards of room 120. The drawings typically consist of smiley faces in the corners of the boards. According to one report, a student left the room after class, remembering the boards to be blank. A few minutes later, realizing that he forgot something, the student re-entered the room to find smiley faces in the corners of the board, without anybody nearby to draw them. The source of these drawings is believed to be from Mildred Hedges, but this is unconfirmed.
