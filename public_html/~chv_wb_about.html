    <h1>About:</h1>

        <p>This is a page about Simpson's haunted places. All of these experiences are real, and have been documented for your entertainment.</p>
        <p>Our hunters have spent hours on lockdown inside these locations. Some have come out alive, and others haven't. Please take caution at any attempts       to interact with spirits.</p>
        <p>--Beware of the potential consequences!--</p>
        <p style="font-weight: bold;">DO NOT TRY THIS ALONE!</p>
