    <h1>About Cowles Gym Hauntings: </h1>
        <p>Cowles Gym is haunted by many different entities. The Simpson Ghost Hunters have performed multiple overnight experiments in the gym and discovered          unbelievable results. While observing the softball closet corner objects seemed to be thrown at our hunters. Screams, banging on doors and lights               flickering when no one else was around has also been reported.</p>
