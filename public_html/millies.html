    <h1>Millie's Story:</h1>
    
        <p>Albert is a former student who died by overdosing on caffeine. He was found behind the counter after he broke in to get some desperately needed              coffee for finals. This coffee shop is also named after Mildred the ghost of college hall and Mary Berry.</p>
