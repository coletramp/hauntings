			<b>Location: Millie's</b><br>
			<br><b>Paranormal Entity: Albert</b><br>
			According to the legend, Albert was found behind the counter of Millie's after he broke in to get some desperately needed coffee while studying for finals. The next day he was found dead, presumably by caffeine overdose. Since this day, students have reported seeing the coffee machines turn on late at night without explanation.

			<br><b>Unconfirmed Rumor: Flickering Lights</b><br>
			There’s an unconfirmed rumor that the lights within Millie’s will occasionally flicker late at night. However, our hunters have yet to witness this event.
