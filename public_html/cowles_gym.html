<p>Cowles Gym is haunted by many different entities. The Simpson Ghost Hunters have performed multiple overnight experiments in the gym and discovered unbelievable results. While observing the softball closet corner objects seemed to be thrown at our hunters. Screams, banging on doors and lights flickering when no one else was around has also been reported.</p>
